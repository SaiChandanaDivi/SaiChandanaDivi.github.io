      <q> I came to know Sai during my modules at UPC, BarcelonaTech, where she moved as an Erasmus Mundus exchange student after completing her first year at Swansea University. Sai obtained a scholarship for undertaking this program due to her exceptional academic record and a stand-out application. After coming to UPC, she excelled both in practical and theoretical research work. During the classes, she made many valuable contributions to the discussions and was one of the finest students to look out for. She appeared extremely intelligent and self-motivated. The quality of her projects and assignments demonstrated an excellent grasp of advanced discretization methods and numerical modeling skills, as well as a strong hold of computational mechanics tools.</q><br><br>

<q>Ms. Sai Chandana Divi spent her summer 2015 three-month internship within ASTUTE 2020 research group at Swansea University under my supervision. The ASTUTE 2020 (Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies) operation has been part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund through the Welsh Government and the participating Higher Education Institutions. The operation aims at embedding Advanced and Sustainable Technologies into High-Value Manufacturing across Wales by working collaboratively with Welsh businesses.<br><br> Ms. Divi had the opportunity to be part of a selected team from ASTUTE 2020 involved in collaborative research with the Aluminium Lighting Company (ALC). The team was responsible for studying the strength of lighting columns under various material characteristics and loading conditions. Moreover, ALC designed a novel hinge model for easy maintenance of the columns. It was necessary to study the performance of the proposed model design under different loading conditions.<br><br> Ms. Divi has taken part in various stages of the development of computational modelling of the hinge model. She was able to modify the design two models using Solid-works, study the mechanical behaviour of the system and finally analyse the performance under various loading conditions using ANSYS. As these models consists of a spring, it was necessary to characterise the spring, under the manufacturer standard, depending on the different loading conditions and performed buckling analysis of the spring to obtain the load multiplier.<br><br> Ms. Divi was able to work independently, paying attention to all the details in every aspect of the tasks leading to a high quality research work. At the end of her stay at Swansea, she submitted a very detailed research report and presentation, unveiling her depth knowledge in Computational Mechanics and research skills gained using both Solid-works and ANSYS.<br><br> With these skills, I believe she will be a perfect researcher and I strongly support her. I highly recommend her for the great research works that requires enthusiasm, intelligence, speed, patience and a positive attitude.</q><br><br>

<q>Sai has been one of my students in the College of Engineering at Swansea University. I taught her in academic year 2015-2016 as part of the Erasmus Mundus MSc in Computational Mechanics programme, which is run in our College in conjunction with three other leading European institutions, namely Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (Spain), Ecole Centrale de Nantes (France) and University of Stuttgart (Germany), and Tsinghua University (China) (http://www.cimne.com/cm-master).<br><br> Specifically, I was her lecturer on a course in Nonlinear Continuum Mechanics, where her performance was excellent (86%). Sai showed great interest during lectures asking numerous and interesting questions. She attended office hours demonstrating her commitment to the subject. Sai is ranked in the top 5% in her year group with an average above 80%.<br><br> She carried out her second year MSc research thesis in Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (Spain). Sai is extremely organised, thorough and methodical. Sai has expressed great interest in continuing her research in the field of computational mechanics. Her ability to write technical reports is excellent, as I can judge from her homework on my subject.</q><br><br>

<q> Sai Chandana joined my group at IIT Madras, Chennai, India in her third year of undergraduate studies. My first impression of her was "an extremely enthusiastic student with a clear focus on learning". She first started as a summer research intern during which time, she has worked on developing finite element models to simulate the self folding of polymer films. Later, she joined my group as a project staff to continue the work on similar problems. Despite not having necessary background in numerical methods in general and finite element method in particular, she could learn the concepts by self study and deliver the project goals.<br><br>She was a highly determined student who wanted to pursue higher studies for a career in scientific research and development. She was an excellent team worker who could easily join hands with other members of the group for scientific discussions and problem solving. I have witnessed her transformation from being a shy, disciplined student to an excellent research scholar with a zeal to excel in scientific research. Besides being academically bright, she has excellent networking abilities with people around her. I am confident that Sai Chandana will fulfil her ambition and continue to excel in her scientific endeavours.<br><br>She will be an excellent addition to any research group or organisation looking for a bright and ambitious colleague with high work ethics.</q><br><br>

<q>Sai is an exceptional asset to have in any team. I got an opportunity to be classmates with Sai during grad school and I'm grateful to have been friends with such a hard-working person. She's methodical, dedicated and very capable. Her research potential and instincts are highly commendable. In addition, she's very kind and makes time out of her schedule to help her friends. She's a very patient teacher and an amazing group player. No matter how dire a situation is, Sai always works with a positive attitude and tries her level best to give her best. You do not come across a combination of talent, dedication and compassion in the academia every day. Sai is, in my opinion, the finest person I've ever met in school and I'm certain she'll make it big wherever she goes. She earns my highest recommendation.</q><br><br>

<q>I have known Sai Chandana Divi since 2014 from IIT Madras where I pursued my masters. Sai and I worked on a projection together during my master Thesis in the mechanics of materials group supervised by Dr. Ratna Kumar Annabattula. It was a great pleasure to work with her on the project which involved discussions, formulating and programming. She is very good at the analytical thinking. She has a great enthusiasm and often motivates in the progression of the project. I wish her a very good luck for her future.</q><br><br>
