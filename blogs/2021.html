<h3>Why haven't I chosen Indian/US/UK Academia â€“ Salary for PhDs</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>1 July 2021</i></p>
<p>The average <b>stipend</b> for PhD students in India is 35,000 INR per month, in USA it is 30,000&dollar; per year, and in UK it would be 17,000&pound; per year. On top of that, unfortunately, students also have to pay tuition fees for the first year in India and UK. In USA, it might be waived by the professor if he got enough funds leaving room for a lot of uncertainty and instability.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the Indian, UK, USA govt. is yet to recognize a PhD as a full-time job; instead, it considers it a student position. All universities in continental EU consider this as a regular 9:00 - 17:00 job, with many benefits included.</p>

<p>In particular, I would like to compare with the Netherlands. All Dutch universities give a <b>salary</b> according to <a href="https://www.caouniversiteiten.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VSNU-CAO-Nederlandse-Universiteiten-2020-ENG.pdf">collective labour agreement for Dutch universities</a>. Until 31st December 2021, the following monthly gross salary levels are application.</p>

<table style="width:20%">
  <tr>
    <th>Grade</th>
    <th>Salary</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P0</td>
    <td>2395 &euro;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P1</td>
    <td>2790 &euro;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P2</td>
    <td>2920 &euro;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P3</td>
    <td>3061 &euro;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>On inception of the <b>employment contract</b>, PhD candidates are placed in grade P0 for a period of 12 months. At the end of this period, you will be placed in salary grade P1. This will continue to P3 for the last year of PhD. In addition to this, PhD candidates receive end-of-year bonus (i.e., 8.3% of the salary received during the calendar year), holiday allowances (8% of your total remuneration), and maternity leave (at least 16 weeks with contract extension).</p>

<p>Many people might think that the cost of living is very high in the Netherlands. That is true. However, there is no significant difference between a PhD and early-stage industrial job holder. Suppose a PhD candidates would like to settle down and start a family or buy a house; it is easily possible with the salary and employement contract provided by the Dutch universitites. Which might be a struggle in India/UK/USA as you would be working under a student contract with very low stipends.</p>

<p>A PhD requires immense dedication, hard work, sincerity, passion and work beyond 9:00 - 17:00. It is important that we recognize the hard work of the PhD students by giving equal salaries compared to their industry counterparts and treat it as a full-time employment rather than a student position.</p>
