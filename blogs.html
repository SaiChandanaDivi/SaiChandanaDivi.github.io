<h3>In the news of CompMech, University of Pavia</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>7 Sep. 2020</i></p>
<p>Computational Mechanics & Advanced Materials (CompMech) group at University of Pavia published a news-article about my current (work-in-process) research work towards scan-based immersed isogeometric analysis. It is an honor to be part of the research group with a great minds and social dynamics. Thanks to Erasmus+ for the exchange opportunity.</p>

<h3>Simulation-challenge for MSc students at TU/e</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>22 June 2020</i></p>
<p> At Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e), I have been involved in a master level course called, Advanced Discretization Techiniques (ADT), to assist Clemens Verhoosel (responsible lecturer) with the instruction-hours, where we assist students to under the concepts of the course and to grade the in-between and final assessment components. Last year (2019), I have noticed that the advanced level topics in the course, students would be ready to perform a real-world computational problems. However, the existing final assessment component was designed based on an abstract or an academic problem. Hence the connection to a real-time application was missing. After this realization, I proposed to Clemens, that it would be nice to redesign the final assessment component to a challenge-based style. He appreciated the idea and gave me a chance to redesign it. We called it <i>simulation-challenge</i>.<p>

<p>In this challenge, we collected a few real-time cases from a few companies, for example Siuox-Lime, Reden, Evalf, Canon printing production, etc., and gave a real-time problem to student groups (each containing two students) in the second week of the course. The groups shoudl pitch an idea in the third week. We assess the pitch with a green, orange and red light. That means with a green light: students are good to go, organe light: students need a minor considerations, red light: they missed-out something major and need to reconsider their proposal and get back to us with-in a week. After the third week, students have another five weeks to work on it. We monitor them closely and let them steer their own projects. At the end of the eighth week, they would present their final proposal to jury-members and submit a report.</p>

<p>Due to COVID-19, we had to do the pilot version online starting on 20 April 2020. Today, we have wrapped up assessing the reports and presentations. Despite the online implementation, I think the simulation-challenge went well with an average grade of 80%. I have observed students enjoying it while brainstorming together with their peers. I have also enjoyed the discussions with them during the instruction-hours twice a week. Thanks to the jury-members from the above mentioned companies in helping us assess the projects not only to academic-level but also to the industry-level. Thanks to Clemens for givng me this opportunity to design a challenge-based assessment component. A point to mention is that the students and companies also made a network thorugh this course and a couple of studetns joined of the companies to perform their final thesis as an intern in the company. Of course, we have a minor fixes to do for the next year implementation and hopefully, we can do it on-campus.</p>

<h3>In the news of CompMech, University of Pavia</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>27 May. 2020</i></p>
<p>Computational Mechanics & Advanced Materials (CompMech) group at University of Pavia published a news-article about my scientific publication on <i>"Error-estimation-based adaptive integration for immersed isogeometric analysis"</i>. The research work for the article was conducted in collaboration with Eindhvoen university of technology (TU/e) under the supervision of Dr. Clemens V. Verhoosel, Prof. E. Harald van Brummelen, Prof. Alessandro Reali, and, Prof. Ferdinando Auricchio. It is sponsored by Erasmus Mundus under joint doctorate program called Simulation Engineering and Entrepreneur Development (SEED). Thanks to Erasmus+ for the funding and exchange opportunity.</p>

<h3>Promovendus promotie (Doctoral defense)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>10 Mar. 2020</i></p>
<p>Hasini Garikapati, one of my colleagues and a dear friend, successfully defended her doctoral thesis on <i>"Computational uncertainty quantification in pressure-driven fracture processes"</i> and graduated with flyring colors. I am very glad that the official ceremony was possible as it was just before the COVID-19 lockdown. It was a great pleasure to be one of her paranymphs. I wish her a good luck with all the future endeavours.</p>

<h3>A one-day workshop at CompMech, University of Pavia</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>10 Feb. 2020</i></p>
<p> Couple of the key contributors of the Finite Cell Method (FCM) and Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) community, Prof. Alexander DÃ¼ster and Dr. Clemens V. Verhoosel, visited Pavia on February 10th. In this occasion, I (on behalf of CompMech group) have arranged a one-day workshop on the current challenges in FCM, especially focused on the issues like integration, application to Additive manufacturing and high Reynolds number flow problems.</p>

<h2>2019</h2>

<h3>Comp-mech fan-moment: first-time listening to Prof. Tom Hughes (the legend of the Isogeometric analysis)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>18 Sep. 2019</i></p>
<p>The main focus of my PhD work is built-on the immersed and isogeometric analysis. Anyone in the field of computational mechanics knows a few popular names. Tom Hughes is, of course, one among them. He is the man behind the famous isogemetric analysis - which binds the Finite element method with splines (from CAD geometries). At Munich, on the occasion of Isogeometric analysis conference, he gave a keynote talk and this is my first time to listen to him after reading many books and papers from him. It was a fan-moment to this young researcher. His talk was, of course, amazing and with a lot of sense of humour, which I think we can not observe in the academic writings (exception to Strang & Fix).</p>

<h3>Start of second-phase of the PhD</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>02 Sep. 2019</i></p>
<p>Throught my academic career has been an exchange/collaboration between two universities. The same is followed for the doctoral program as well. As a part of the Simulation in Engineering and Entrepreneurship Development (SEED) 2017 consortium under Erasmus Mundus joint-doctoral program, I have a chance to collaborate with the Computational Mechanics & Advanced Materials (CompMech) research group at University of Pavia. Hence, I moved to one of the oldest Italian city - Pavia, which hosted academic marvels like A. Volta (man behind the batteries), Einstein and his family for a long time. At the University of Pavia, I will be closely collaborating with Prof. F. Auricchio and Prof. A. Reali. Occasionally, I will also have meetings with Prof. G. Sangali from the Mathematics department. I am looking forward to enjoying not only the research but also the experience of the rich italian heritage.</p>

<h3>Talk at MFET 2019</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>03 July 2019</i></p>
<p>I have got a chance to present in MFET 2019, one of the thematic conferences by ECCOMAS. It was a nice opportunity to see the known people and meet a few new people in the field of computational mechanics. The talks were very interesting, especially, I enjoyed listening to Niels Aage from Denmark TU on topology optimization methods. It was a very happy moment to see and talk to Prof. A. J. Gil (from Swansea University) again after my Swansea days. The post-presentation discussions were interesting and engaging. The conference took place in a beautiful spa town called Bad Honnef near Bonn, Germany.</p>

<h3>Team MEFD at Coupled problems 2019</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px; padding:0"><i>3 July 2019</i></p>
<p>Atleast once a year, Multi-scale Engineering & Fluid Dynamics (MEFD) research team at Eindhoven plans a trip to a conference together. We try to make it a fun team-trip together in addtion to attending interesting talks in the conference. This year we visited Sitges (a beautiful costal town, near Barcelona, Spain) to attend a conference on coupled problems, one of the thematic conferences conducted by ECCOMAS. I have got a chance to present my work in a minisymposium called Embedded domain methods for coupled problems. It was a nice opportunity to see the known people and meet a few new people in the field of computational mechanics. The talks were very interesting, especially, I enjoyed listening to Charbel Farhat from Stanford University on Multidisciplinary and Multiscale Modeling of Aerodynamic Decelerator System. It was a very happy moment to see and talk to Prof. Djordje Peric (from Swansea University) again after my Swansea days.</p>
